# CityExplorer - A prototype for Computational Tourism
A HackZurich project by Jurgen Cito and Giovanni Grano

Visiting any new place usually entails researching places you want to visit while keeping personal constraints in mind (time, interest, budget, etc.).
 Computational tourism leverages all the data we have on these places and allows user to specify their constraints as high level goals. For instance, "I'm at HackZurich and I want to experience some of the nightlife in the area. Show me all bars I can visit in a 2 hour break, I want to spend around 30 minutes in each bar". Given these constraints, our app will retrieve all necessary location data and plan a perfect Pub Crawl route.

We implemented a proof-of-concept as a web application and an iPhone map, using esriMaps.
Here is a screenshot of the web application, that has calculated a Pub Crawl route close to the main train station.
